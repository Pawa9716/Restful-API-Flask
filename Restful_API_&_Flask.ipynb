        "1.What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "  - A RESTful API is a type of application programming interface (API) that follows the architectural principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). It uses standard HTTP methods to interact with resources, enabling applications to exchange data and perform operations on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "  - An API specification is a formal document that outlines the elements of an API, acting as a blueprint for its design and development. It details the API's behavior, including its operations, endpoints, input/output for each call, and the data models it uses. Essentially, it defines how an API should behave and interact with other systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "  - Flask is a lightweight Python microframework ideal for building web applications, including REST APIs. It's known for its simplicity, flexibility, and minimal dependencies, making it easy to create and customize web services. This flexibility and ease of use contribute to its popularity for API development.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "  - Routes in Flask are a fundamental concept in the web framework. routes can be described as the designated paths or endpoints in a web application that correspond to specific functions. These functions are responsible for processing requests and returning the appropriate responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "  - Create a basic Flask project as described in Creating a Flask Project to start prototyping the application. Select Flask in the New Project dialog. In the Location field, provide the path to the project location and type meteoMaster as the project name. Leave the rest of the settings default and click Create.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "  - In RESTful APIs, the most commonly used HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. These methods map to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "  - The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to associate a specific URL path with a function, also known as a view function. This is how Flask handles routing — determining what code should run when a user visits a certain URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "  - The main difference between GET and POST HTTP methods lies in their intended use: GET is for retrieving data, while POST is for sending data to the server, often for creating or updating resources. GET requests send data in the URL, making it visible and cacheable, while POST requests send data in the request body, keeping it hidden and not typically cacheable.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "  - Flask allows defining routes and functions in a Python file so create an app.py file for our main flask app. We set up the main page route ('/') and a 404 error handler using Flask's built-in function. The above python program will return 404. html file whenever the user opens a broken link.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.How do you connect Flask to a SQL database.\n",
        "  - Connecting to the MySQL database in a Flask app\n",
        "Step 1: Create the getdb function. We are going to write the connection code once in the getdb function and return the database connection anytime it's needed in our routes. ...\n",
        "Step 2: Close the database connection after each request. ...\n",
        "Step 3: Use the getdb function in routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "  - Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that makes using SQLAlchemy with Flask easier, providing you tools and methods to interact with your database in your Flask applications through SQLAlchemy. In this tutorial, you'll build a small student management system that demonstrates how to use the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful.\n",
        "  - Each Flask Blueprint is an object that works very similarly to a Flask application. They both can have resources, such as static files, templates, and views that are associated with routes. However, a Flask Blueprint is not actually an application. It needs to be registered in an application before you can run it.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is the purpose of Flask's request object.\n",
        "  - The Flask Request Object is used to perform both sending and receiving operations from a user's browser to the server and process the request data from the server. It should be imported from the flask module.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask.\n",
        "  - Here's how to create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask: install flask.\n",
        "Code\n",
        "\n",
        "    pip install Flask\n",
        "Create a Flask app.\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    from flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n",
        "    app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "Define the endpoint and HTTP method.\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    @app.route('/items', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n",
        "    def handle_items():\n",
        "        if request.method == 'GET':\n",
        "            # Logic to retrieve and return all items\n",
        "            items = [{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Item 1\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Item 2\"}] # Example data\n",
        "            return jsonify(items)\n",
        "        elif request.method == 'POST':\n",
        "            # Logic to create a new item\n",
        "            new_item = request.get_json()\n",
        "            # Process and save the new item\n",
        "            new_item['id'] = 3 # Assign a new ID (in real scenario, use a database)\n",
        "            return jsonify(new_item), 201 # Return the created item and 201 status code\n",
        "run the flask app.\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "        app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "This example creates an endpoint /items that handles both GET and POST requests.\n",
        "GET requests retrieve a list of items.\n",
        "POST requests create a new item, taking data from the request body.\n",
        "For more complex APIs, consider using Flask extensions like Flask-RESTful or Flask-API to simplify development.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "  - Flask's jsonify() function simplifies creating JSON responses in web applications. It takes Python objects (usually dictionaries) and converts them into a JSON-formatted string, automatically setting the Content-Type header to application/json and returning a Flask Response object. This allows developers to focus on the data they want to send back to the client, without worrying about manual serialization or header management.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n",
        "  - Flask’s url_for() function is used to dynamically build URLs for your view functions based on the function name, rather than hardcoding the URLs directly. This makes your code more maintainable and less error-prone, especially if URLs change later.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)\n",
        "  - Flask automatically creates a static endpoint to serve static files (like HTML templates, CSS stylesheets, JS files, and images). For example, to serve an image, copy the image into the \"static\" folder of the Flask project. Create a new route and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/logo.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API.\n",
        "  - An API specification is a formal, structured description of how an API behaves — what endpoints it offers, what parameters it accepts, what data it returns, and how errors are handled. It acts as a blueprint for both developers and machines.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "  - HTTP status codes are three-digit codes that indicate the outcome of an API request. They are included in the API's response to the API client, and they include important information that helps the client know how to proceed.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.How do you handle POST requests in Flask.\n",
        "  - Handling POST requests in Flask involves specifying the allowed methods in the route decorator and accessing the request data. The request object from the flask module provides access to incoming request data, which can be in the form of form data or JSON data.\n",
        "To handle POST requests, the methods parameter in the @app.route decorator should include POST. The data sent with the POST request can then be accessed using request.form for form data or request.get_json() for JSON data.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.How would you secure a Flask API.\n",
        "  - To protect your APIs built with Flask, it is essential to address several key security aspects: Use HTTPS: Employing HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension.\n",
        "  - The Flask RESTful extension significantly simplifies REST API development within Flask applications. It provides a more structured and efficient way to define API endpoints, handle HTTP methods, and manage resources compared to using Flask directly. Flask RESTful is particularly helpful for building RESTful APIs, offering features like automatic request parsing, response formatting, and resource-oriented design.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What is the role of Flask’s session object.\n",
        "  - In Flask, the session object allows you to store user-specific data across multiple HTTP requests. It acts as a way to persist data between different interactions with a web application, making it possible to remember information like login status, preferences, or other user-related data. Essentially, it enables Flask to maintain a state of the user's interaction with the application."
